Below is one possible JSON answer based on the information we could extract from the Nordic American Tankers Limited annual report. In our review of the consolidated financial statements (see the cash‐flows and operations sections in 91ba1d46cdde9c1c0cf34f6… and 91ba1d46cdde9c1c0cf34f6…), we found that for the 2022 reporting period:

• The consolidated statement of cash flows shows that the net cash provided by operating activities was USD 24,134 (in thousands).
• Although the report states that aggregate cash compensation to directors and executive officers was USD 5.5 million, no breakdown is provided to identify a “largest single” payment – so that measure is not available.
• In the narrative section discussing dividends (see 91ba1d46cdde9c1c0cf34f6…), the report notes that 2022 dividends totaled USD 0.11 per share.
• In the investing section of the cash flow statement the Company’s investments include newbuild expenditures of USD 90,301 (thousands) and investments in vessels of USD 5,116 (thousands); the sum (approximately USD 95,417 in absolute terms) is taken as the capital expenditures.
• As a shipping company, Nordic American Tankers does not report spending on advanced R&D programs nor any expensed R&D – so both these measures are not available.
• The consolidated statement of operations shows voyage revenues of USD 339,340 (thousands) for 2022, which we use as total revenue.
• Finally, no separate “deposits” line item was identified in the balance sheet, so that measure is not available.

Because the report’s pages are identified with internal labels (e.g. “F‑8” for the cash flow statement and “F‑4” for the operations statement), we have used those as a proxy for the reference numbers (by stripping the “F‑” and using the numeral). (For example, the cash flow data comes from “F‑8” – we therefore use 8; dividend data appears on a page labelled “31,” so we use 31; and revenue appears on “F‑4,” so we use 4.)

The final JSON output is therefore as follows:

  ]
}
In summary, while we were able to extract figures for cash flow from operations, dividends per share, capital expenditures (as the sum of investments in newbuilds and vessels), and total revenue, the report did not provide a breakdown for the largest single executive compensation, nor did it report any R&D or deposit data.
